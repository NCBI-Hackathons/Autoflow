# Autopipeline
A fast, easy way to present complex bioinformatics pipelines to biologists, built on top of ATACFlow (https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/ATACFlow).

# Outline
Build a pipeline packager and allow users to “build” their own pipelines. Biologists will select tools they want to include. Make it easy for biologists to take complex bioinformatics workflows and run them. Auto pipeline will be in a standard framework (i.e. CWL)
